# IsogenyPoKviaCanonicalModPolys
Sage scripts for the paper "More Efficient Isogeny Proofs of Knowledge via Canonical Modular Polynomials" ([ADDLINKHERE])

-  The script `constraints.sage` expresses and verifies all arithmetizations; furthermore it automatically counts the number of constraints, variabls and non-zero entries.
-  The script `kernel_polynomials.sage` verifies the computational claims in the proof of the Reconstruction Theorem.
-  The script `maximal_primes.sage` verifies the computational claims needed to determine the maximal prime for which there exist at least three undirected edges between some pair of vertices in the supersingular isogeny graph.
